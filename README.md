# Unity Flappy Bird Game
 Flappy Bird Game created with Unity using their tutorial as a reference

This was the first time I created a game using Unity, the first time I created a Game and also the first time coding in C#. This was a very eye opening and enjoyable experience which gave me my first touch at game design, something I always wanted to do but never had to time to. After doing this tutorial, I am more interested in trying out other Unity tutorials and maybe even start on a project of my own when I have more time during the holidays. Maybe a Tower Defense or RPG game? However, this has also made me want to go learn C# first as well to brush up on my C# skills as well as learn a new programming language.
